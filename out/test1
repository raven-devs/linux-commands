Vim has a steep learning curve due to its unique interface and extensive set of features,
but it can be extremely powerful once you become proficient with it.

Many developers and system administrators use Vim as their preferred text editor for its efficiency and flexibility.

The "tail" command is a Unix and Linux command-line utility that is used to display the last few lines of a text file or a stream of text.

It is particularly useful for viewing the most recent entries in log files or monitoring the output of continuously updated files. The "tail" command is the opposite of the "head" command, which displays the first few lines of a file.
